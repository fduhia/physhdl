Physical HDL
============

This is the source for a book on Hardware Description Languages -
Verilog and VHDL.

This book does not attempt to teach the details of each language as
there are already plenty of excellent texts that do so.

This book attempts to bridge the gap between the practice of coding in
these languages and the machine interpretation of the code during
synthesis - essential to designing efficient digital structures.

This book illustrates the translation from code to hardware using
real-life physical examples. The idea is so that readers can develop a
deeper understanding of the language and learn how to think like a
synthesis tool after finishing this book.

All VHDL and/or Verilog code provided with this book is released under
the terms of the GPL3 license. The LaTeX source code for the book is
released under the terms of the GFDL1.3 license.
